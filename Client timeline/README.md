During one of my internships, my supervisor asked me to sort out the timeline of deliverables for Q3 2020. The dates of deliverables should avoid weekends and holidays, 
and the time intervals between two adjacent deliverables had better be stable. I thought the most convenient way to do this is to refer to last quarter's timeline, and just
convert the dates of last quarter to those of this quarter. Therefore, I wrote this python program with the package "workelendar" for this purpose.
